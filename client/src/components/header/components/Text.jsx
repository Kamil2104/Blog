        <h1> Hello, I&apos;m Kamil! </h1>
        <p> 
            I&apos;m an 18-year-old student majoring in programming engineering. 
            In school I&apos;ve been learning the basics of programming.
            I set the goal to become a web developer one day, so I decided to take my basics to the next level - by myself.
            Here I am - I&apos;ve created a blog web application using for example React, Express and Jest, which I&apos;ve been learning since November 27, 2023.
            I hope you will enjoy this page :)   
        </p>
