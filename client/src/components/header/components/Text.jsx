      <h1> Hello, I&apos;m Kamil! </h1>
      <p> 
          Welcome on my blog page! <br />
          I&apos;m going to share with you here the news about situations, which happened to me. 
          {/* I&apos;m an 18-year-old student majoring in programming engineering. <br />
          In school I&apos;ve been learning the basics of programming, but I set the goal to become a web developer one day, so I decided to take my basics to the next level - by myself. <br />
          Here I am - I&apos;ve created a blog web application using for example React and Express, which I&apos;ve been learning since November 27, 2023. <br />
          I hope you will enjoy this page :)    */}
